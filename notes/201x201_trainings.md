# 201x201 trainings

Following the study made on 101x101 resolution, application of the tendencies found in 201x201 is studied here.

## Dataset

The `random_8` seemed to work best for 101 resolution. Should we use `random_16` or `random_8` in 201 resolution to get the same behavior of the network? If only the number of pixels of structure matters then `random_8` should be kept.

# 9_RF_study notes

Notes concerning the directory of networks contained in `9_RF_study/`

It was noticed that the Unets with a rf 200 and ks 3 were not correctly calculated.
Thus, several trainings are relaunched to try to get the correct tendencies 

The networks are first trained on 101x101 domains.

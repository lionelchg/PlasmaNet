# Summary of datasets used

All sizes of dataset are 10000 to begin.

## Random datasets

The value of the density associated to rhs is n = $10^{11}$ as in the target case

### random_4

Random dataset with initial random values taken on a 101 / 4 = 25 x 25 grid

### random_8

Random dataset with initial random values taken on a 101 / 8 = 12 x 12 grid

### random_16

Random dataset with initial random values taken on a 101 / 16 = 6 x 6 grid

### random_4_8

Half `random_4`, half `random_8`

### random_8_16

Half `random_8`, half `random_16`

### random_4_8_16

`random_4`, `random_8`, `random_16` one third each

## Random fourier datasets

The value of the density associated to rhs is n = $10^{11}$ as in the target case

### random_5

5 modes with no selection of frequencies

### random_5_2

5 modes with square decreasing frequency with n and m

### random_5_4

5 modes with power of 4 decreasing frequency with n and m

## Hills datasets

In this case the simulation dataset and the hills dataset are the same

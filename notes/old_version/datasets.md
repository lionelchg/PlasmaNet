# Random datasets
The value of the density associated to rhs is n = $10^{11}$ as in the target case
## random_4
Random dataset with initial random values taken on a 101 / 4 = 25 x 25 grid
## random_8
Random dataset with initial random values taken on a 101 / 8 = 12 x 12 grid
## random_16
Random dataset with initial random values taken on a 101 / 16 = 6 x 6 grid

# Random fourier datasets
The value of the density associated to rhs is n = $10^{11}$ as in the target case
## random_5
5 modes with no selection of frequencies

## random_5_2
5 modes with square decreasing frequency with n and m

## random_5_4
5 modes with power of 4 decreasing frequency with n and m

# Hills datasets

In this case the simulation dataset and the hills dataset are the same

# Simulation datasets

About precision the electric field is direclty under a divergence in the drift-diffusion model.
In the Euler equations the link is less straightforward, is there an impact for the precision?
